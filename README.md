# myEconomyULTRA
The myEconomy Game... but with Business
# What is it?
myEconomyULTRA is the latest in the myEconomy range of games. With over 12,000 lines of code, this modification allows users to either simulate as a government or as a business. With a heavy focus on the business side of this game, myEconomyULTRA allows you to either step into the shoes of your favourite politician or your favourite businessman. With complex customisation, you can ensure your country or business is fit to YOUR liking.
# How do I play?
Unfortunately, myEconomyULTRA is not yet production-ready. Right now, the only way to play is to manually run the python file yourself. You will need to install python, then make sure all the correct modules are installed e.g "pip install customtkinter" or "pip install flask". Then, in terminal/CMD prompt, type: "python myEconomyUltra.py" to run the game.
